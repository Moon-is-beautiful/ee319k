Distributed Data Acquisition System

Purpose:
The objectives of this lab are to: 
learn how the UART works using both busy-wait and interrupt synchronization; 
employ a software FIFO to buffer data from UART1 receiver ISR to main program;
study synchronization issues in a distributed data acquisition system. This lab is demonstrated on two TM4C123 boards (full duplex). 

consists of C and assembly
